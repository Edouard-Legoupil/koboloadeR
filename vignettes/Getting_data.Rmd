## Shiny Apps

The package contains the following Shiny apps, accessible via `kobo_apps("app_name")`:

App | Description
---|---
`"data_viewer"` | The `"data_viewer"` app provides a basic login screen to authenticate against the specified API. Once authenticated, the datasets available via the specified login are displayed, and a dropdown list is populated with which one can select the dataset they want to view. The dataset is also made available in the users Global Environment.

Here's [a blog post introducing the package](http://news.mrdwab.com/post/koboloader/)!





## From API

The following examples access the public data available via KoBo Toolbox. Note that all of the functions have been set with defaults of `user = NULL` and `api = 'kobo'`.

```
kobo_datasets()[, c("description", "id"), with = FALSE] ## Just show the first two columns

kobo_submission_count(4163)
# [1] 37

kobo_data_downloader("4163")
# No local dataset found.
# Downloading remote file.
# ... The contents would normally be printed here

### On a subsequent run, if the file is already there and no changes have been made
kobo_data_downloader("4163")
# Number of rows in local and remote file match.
# Using local file.
```

The `kobo_data_downloader` automatically checks for the existence of an object in your workspace named "data_####" (where "####" is the numeric form ID). If such an object is found, it then uses `kobo_submission_count` to compare the number of rows in the local dataset against the number of rows in the remote dataset. If the number is found to be different, the remote dataset is re-downloaded. If they are found to be the same, the local dataset is used. 

In the future, it is intended that there would be a more robust and efficient method rather than redownloading the entire dataset each time a change has been detected.

--------------

Run the examples at the help pages to get a sense of some of the other features:

```
example("kobo_datasets")
example("kobo_submission_count")
example("kobo_data_downloader")
```

## Authentication

These functions all use basic HTTP authentication. The easiest way to enter the password details is the common `"username:password"` approach. Thus, when accessing form data using authentication, the function would be used in the following manner:

```
kobo_data_downloader("123456", "username:password")
```
